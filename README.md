# BasicNeuralNetworkUsingKeras

This simple project is done as a process of learning. I have taken the code from the website 
link : https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/

Jason Browlee, the author of that website has clearly exaplained about how to create a simple neural network model using keras.

Keras is a python library for Deep Learning.

Following steps are performed in the code.


->How to load data.
->How to define neural network in Keras.
->How to compile a Keras model using the efficient numerical backend.
->How to train a model on data.
->How to evaluate a model on data
